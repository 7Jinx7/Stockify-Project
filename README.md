Stockify: A Stock Market Simulator Game
Stockify is an interactive stock market simulation game built using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. The game allows users to explore stock market trading through a simplified, engaging interface while learning about concepts such as ticker symbols, stock performance, and profit/loss calculations.

How It Works

1. Setup: A random payday balance is generated.
The user is introduced to stock trading and given a list of stocks with their ticker symbols.
2. Stock Selection: Users pick three stocks from the list and specify the quantity of shares they wish to purchase.
The program calculates the stock price changes and determines gains or losses.
3. Stock Performance: A simulated DataFrame shows the performance of stocks over seven days.
The game uses random data generation to emulate real stock performance.
4. Profit/Loss Calculation: Based on the user's stock selections and the final prices, the game calculates:
Total gains or losses for each stock.
The overall balance (starting balance + total gains/losses).
Whether the user made a profit, a loss, or broke even.
5. Result: A final summary shows the user's ending balance and profit/loss status.
